# Global Tech Layoff Post-Pandemic Analysis

## Project Background

The labor force in tech companies around the globe drastically shifted throughout the different stages of the pandemic. Anti-pandemic measures drove increased demand for online services and automation while reducing demand in areas like travel and in-person events. As a result, tech companies restructured their workforces during and after the pandemic in response to these shifts and subsequent economic stabilization.
